# EFCAD

This EFCAD tool flow combines a chain of academic tools for building partially reconfigurable modules on lightweight embedded platforms.
The target platform is UltraZed with the latest 16nm UltraScale+ FPGAs tightly coupled with the 64-bit ARM CPUs in the same die of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device.
